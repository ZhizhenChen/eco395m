Hi everyone, I'm Zhizhen Chen from China, and I'm a first-year master's student in Operations Research and Industrial Engineering. I'm really interested in causal inference and its applications in multilateral market trading.
I did my undergraduate in data science, and Iâ€™m hoping the economics side of things will give me more insight.
Outside of academics, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, and going to concerts. 
Happy to meet y'all!
